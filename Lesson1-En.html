                    <h2>Basic Circuit Story</h2>
                    <div class="THE-TEXT--DELETE-ME-AFTER-FINISH">
                        <p>Have you ever wondered how devices like lamp, tv, your phone and computers are working?
                             It‚Äôs all about electricity or in another word electric current. Electric current is like food, as food gives you energy, current is the energy for these devices. 
                             Now you may be wondering what does current mean right? Don‚Äôt worry we are here to explain that to you üòÅ.
                             If I asked you now how to make for example a lamp to light you, you are going to tell me to that I need electricity for that.
                             So, to do that first we need a circuit from its name it is like a circle specifically a closed path to allow current to flow.
                             Think of a circuit as a train track as long as there is a track the train continue moving and when the track is ended the train stops.
                             Current is the flow of electrons moving across a conductor material that can allow the electrons to go through.
                             So, to make our lamp to light we need a conductor and a closed path but there is a problem here, are these electrons are going to move all the way through
                             our conductor wire to reach the lamp?
                            Actually, they can‚Äôt do that alone, so we need to help our little electrons and make them reach the lamp using a power source to give them energy.</p>

                        <p>The power source is like a battery it gives our friendly electrons a power called voltage to reach the lamp and bring the light to your lovely room.
                             Now our friends have enough power to make it but like any story there is a villain wants to slow us down.
                             We also have a villain here it called a resistor. This evil resistor wants to slow our electrons down or even break the flow.</p>

                        <p>Think of it like a water hose the water drops are our friends the electrons and the pump is
                             our power source and the switch is the resistance preventing the water to be released.
                             To make our lamp to light we need a lot of electrons to defeat the resistance and power source to help them and finally we have
                             our lamp working and you successfully lighten your room and If you want to increase the light just increase the number of electrons and boom you have a stronger light üòÅ.</p>
